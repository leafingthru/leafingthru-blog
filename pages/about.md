## About the author
I’m Meagan, my pronouns are they/them, and I’m writing this page from Quezon City, Philippines.

I’m interested in places of learning, recollecting and reflecting. In line with this, I do research work with museums and organizations.

In my free time, I read, cook and try out different art media and crafts.
